# Lookup

This app is a kind of analog of the [RevitLookup](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup) but only for the TeklaStructures. 
It's possible to do next actions with it:

1. See all possible names of **fields**, **properties**, **methods** (both private and public).
2. Browse all kinds of **values** of private and public fields and properties.
3. **Get** and **browse values** of private and public **methods**, which don't require setting any parameters.

The code of the program works through the .Net Framework System.Reflection mechanism and gives to a user all information that it's possible to take from the TeklaStructures API.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
